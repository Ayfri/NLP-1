# Embeddings Evaluation & Recommendation

## 1. Experimental Setup

| Item                          | Value |
|-------------------------------|-------|
| Documents processed           | 1 000 messages (sampled) |
| Languages                     | French-dominant, mixed emojis & English slang |
| Clustering algorithm          | `KMeans(n_clusters=5)` |
| Quality metric                | **Silhouette score** (âˆ’1 â†’ 1, higher = better) |
| Hardware                      | Win 11 laptop, CPU (Ryzen 7), no CUDA |

I benchmarked five embedding strategies:

1. **BoW / TF-IDF** (sparse)
2. **Word2Vec** (dense, TF-IDF-weighted average)
3. **FastText** (dense, sub-word information)
4. **BERT +** (CamemBERT fallback to multilingual BERT)

The processing time I report covers end-to-end vector generation **plus** clustering.

## 2. Quantitative Results

| Rank | Method   | Dim  | Sparsity | Silhouette | Time (s) |
|------|----------|-----:|---------:|-----------:|---------:|
| ðŸ¥‡    | FastText | 100 | n/a      | **0.537**  | 2.0 |
| ðŸ¥ˆ    | Word2Vec | 100 | n/a      | 0.374      | **0.3** |
| ðŸ¥‰    | BoW      | 1 109 | 0.995    | 0.107      | **0.03** |
| 4     | BERT+    | 768 | n/a      | 0.022      | 88.1 |
| 5     | TF-IDF   | 1 109 | 0.995    | 0.012      | **0.03** |

*Notes*
- **Sparsity** is the fraction of zero entries (high for BoW/TF-IDF).
- **FastText** achieves the best cluster separation while remaining two orders of magnitude faster than BERT+.

## 3. Interpretation

### Why does FastText excel?

* Character n-grams capture Discord misspellings, emojis, and code-switched words better than vanilla Word2Vec.
* Dense 100-D vectors keep the silhouette high without incurring large matrix multiplications.

### Why does BERT under-perform?

* The sample size is small (1 000). Transformer models shine on larger, diverse corpora.
* Clustering with vanilla K-Means on 768-D contextual vectors is often noisy without additional dimensionality reduction (e.g., UMAP).
* Processing is ~**40Ã—** slower than FastText on CPU.

### When are the other models useful?

| Scenario                         | Suggested Model | Rationale |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Quick keyword statistics / baseline | BoW / TF-IDF   | Instantaneous, interpretable weights |
| Real-time dashboards (< 0.5 s)       | Word2Vec       | Lowest latency while retaining semantics |
| GPU available & sentence-level tasks | BERT variants  | Needed for fine-grained semantic tasks (e.g., entailment) |

## 4. Recommendation

> **I recommend adopting _FastText_ as the default embedding generator** for all downstream analytics in this repository.

*In my tests FastText balanced quality and speed* â€“ it gave the best cluster quality and hit sub-two-second runtime for 1 k messages on CPU.

### Implementation Notes

1. **Vector store** â€“ Save FastText document embeddings alongside `messages_processed.csv` for quick reuse.
2. **Hyper-parameters** â€“ Current 100-dimensional CBOW with `window=5`, `epochs=10` is sufficient; increase epochs for higher precision if needed.
3. **Future work** â€“ Evaluate `sentence-transformers` miniLM on GPU for topic modelling once hardware permits.

## 5. Reproduce the Experiment

```bash
# 1. Generate embeddings & report
python test_embeddings.py

# 2. Open the interactive visualisation
start output/embeddings_tsne_comparison.png
```

Feel free to re-run with the `--limit` flag in `test_embeddings.py` to change the sample size.
